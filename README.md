# Lights-Rails

Lights-Rails is a Ruby on Rails app that serves as the backend for the [Lights iOS app](https://github.com/edc1591/Lights-iOS) that allows you to control RGB LEDs and X10 devices.

## Installation

This app is designed to be easily deployed to a service like Heroku. Serveral environmental variables must be set:

1. `LIGHTS_SECRET` is the standard Rails secret token which you can generate by running `rake secret`.
2. `DEVISE_SECRET` which is the secret used by the [Devise gem](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) which can also be generated by running `rake secret`.
3. `DEVISE_SENDER` is the email address used by Devise.
4. `EXCEPTION_SENDER` is the email address to send exception notifications from.
5. `EXCEPTION_RECIPIENT` is the email address to send exception notifications to.

Create and seed the database

    rake db:setup
    
and run the server
